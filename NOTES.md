#### Pulled out some copy
Some copy to use for the History / Experience section:
I had this in the about at first but I think it is too long and needs to be separated.

```
<p className="about__text">
  I started coding professionally in late 2017, but my first code
  tinkering dates back to embedding my favourite songs into my MySpace
  page and hacking my install of Medal of Honor to get top score
  (sorry...).
</p>
<p className="about__text">
  What makes me a great developer, besides my absolute love for the
  things a series of characters can manifest, is my diversity of
  experience. I studied Creative Writing and English at the University
  of Victoria and graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts. I spent my
  twenties working as a leader and creative in the Canadian media arts
  community. I worked as the Program Director and Station Manager at
  CFUV 101.9 FM, Victoria's campus and community radio station, where I
  created unique and award-winng audio and video content, and managed a
  small full-time staff team and volunteerbase of over 200 community
  members. , Editor for Weird Canada, and the President of the National
  Campus and Community Radio Association. Throughout these roles
